- `@testing-library/user-event` version:
<!--
If your version doesn't match this project's current release found at
https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/releases, please try upgrading
to see if that solves your issue. This especially may be the case if you are
using Create React App, which currently provides an older version of user-event.
-->

- Testing Framework and version:
  <!-- are you using jest, mocha, puppeteer, ava? And what version? -->
- DOM Environment:
  <!-- If you're using jsdom (the default with jest), what version? Otherwise, what browser and version are you running tests in? -->

<!--
Keep in mind that if you're using a version of node we don't support that
could also be an issue. Check our package.json "engines" file for the
supported version.
